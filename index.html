        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Nice to meet you! I'm Adam Rinehouse, a Dartmouth College class of '19, hailing from Northeast Pennsylvania (in a region
          near Scranton, home of NBC's <em>The Office</em>. I'm currently majoring in Computer Science and Music. I've
          been an active member of the Dali Lab since fall of 2016, and quickly felt right at home there. I'm also an active
          percussionist and composer, with a background in choral singing, and have played as a member of the Dartmouth
          College Wind Ensemble since I got to Dartmouth in 2015. Oh, and that picture up there, that's me with my family's new puppy,
          Bentley. If you'd like to learn more about me, scroll down to check out some of my past projects, both analog
          and digital!</p>

        <h2>Programming Projects</h2>
        <p>I started coding in my senior year of high school, learning Java for AP Computer Science. Since then I've been active
          trying to learn many new languages. In the summer between freshman and sophomore year, I learned a little bit of Swift
          Python, as well as the Command Line. Since joining Dali, I've had to learn C# (and the Unity framework), HTML and CSS,
          and of course Git. I've also worked briefly with a startup called BookUp, where I learned React.js</p>

        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>Music has been as much a hobby as a field of study for me since middle school, when I took up the drum set. I learned jazz
          alongside classical music, but I've always loved rock and alternative music. Nobody teaches classes on that, so a couple of
          friends and I threw a band together--check us out on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/band-ana">SoundCloud</a>!
          I also took part in the Performing Arts Institute in my area, where I was introduced to conductor Matt Marsit, who in turn
          introduced me to Dartmouth College. Since arriving here, I've been exploring new fields in music--French Horn, composition,
          and maybe soon some conducting! I also do a little bit of teaching, leading biweekly sectionals as Hanover High School, and
          working every Saturday in the winter with the Dartmouth Youth Wind Ensemble, made up of middle schoolers from the
          Upper Valley.</p>
